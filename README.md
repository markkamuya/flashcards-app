# Web Development Project 3 - *Flashcards App*

Submitted by: **Mark Kamuya**

This web app: **Programming Languages Flashcards Trivia is an interactive web application that helps users test and improve their knowledge of popular programming languages. The app presents questions about languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and more. Users can answer the questions, mark them as "mastered" once they get them correct, and track their progress with streaks. The app also allows users to shuffle the cards, navigate through the quiz, and try again if they make a mistake. Once all questions are mastered, a congratulatory message appears, and users can restart the quiz.**
